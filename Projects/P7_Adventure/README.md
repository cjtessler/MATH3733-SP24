# Project 7: Adventure

The final project is your opportunity to take your newfound savvy with programming out for a spin and develop your very own piece of software or learn an application of Python and present that. As long as your project draws upon the courseâ€™s lessons, the nature of your project is entirely up to you, albeit subject to approval.

You may should use generative AI tools such as [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) or a more general tool such as ChatGPT or Claude. Although, it is important to understand the code it provides and how to utilize it to improve your own projects. Therefore, you will also submit a screenscast where you talk through your development process, fully explain your project, and reflect on the use of AI.

## Pre-project (Due Sunday, April 14th)

Research some possible projects. At this point, you have a solid foundation in Python so don't be afraid of loftier ideas. Think of a problem you want to solve or a something you want to build, use a tutorial to learn the basics of any new library you need to use, and then independently build your idea. Building your own project is worth dozens of tutorials. If you are unsure on what you want to do, try the following:

1. Think of a problem you would like to solve.
2. Research a topic that interests you.
3. Review the list of ideas provided below.
4. Come talk to me.

Write a 250 word (minimum) plan for your project. Include a clear specification of what you plan to build, links to any tutorials you may use, the features you plan to implement, and what you envision for your presentation. Feel free to use images, mockups, and/or whatever you deem appropriate to explain your goal. Your project will evolve as you write it, but it is important to have a clear goal before you begin coding. **Submit your plan on MyFire before Sunday, April 14th 11:59 PM.**

Here is a list of ideas and frameworks you can look into: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_D9k83syKltGZbj_Kr6p300SUxW5WD6vXOn_aig0k6g/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_D9k83syKltGZbj_Kr6p300SUxW5WD6vXOn_aig0k6g/edit?usp=sharing).

Here are two exemplar pre-project plans:

- [Mad Libs with Tkinter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_MYhLJkw4KDKHmHZXLoNWuqug1QPyodA/view?usp=drive_link)
- [Flask Budget App](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3feLfhrypGHRAoTPH2hKj9L9eGLYbYP/view?usp=drive_link)

If your project is based on a tutorial, you must **significantly** extend the functionalities of the program in order to earn full points. Only the parts that you write will be considered towards the project grade. Turning in a project that is a only the code from a tutorial will result in a poor grade (potentially zero).

## Expectations

Here are the expectations:

- The project is to be an independent endeavor. You are welcome to talk to your peers about your project, but each student is expected to complete a unique project.

- You use AI to iteratively develop and improve your project.

- Cite *any* assistance you use. This includes generative AI, tutorials, Stack Overflow answers, GitHub repositories, and any other ideas or examples you see and implement into your project. You may cite the code inline using comment. For example,

```python
# ChatGPT 3.5: Write me a Python class for a character in a text-based game I am making
class Character:
    def __init__(self, name, health=100, attack=10, defense=5):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.max_health = health
        self.attack = attack
        self.defense = defense
```

- Your project should demonstrate mastery of many, if not all, of the programming concepts covered in class: variables, functions, control flow, iteration, strings, classes, data structures, etc.

- Submit a screenscast where you talk through your development process, fully explain your project, and reflect on the use of AI.

- Put in the time necessary outside of class to complete a polished project.

## Submission

A **project plan** is due on **Sunday, April 14th, 11:59 PM**.

The **project** is due on **Sunday, April 21th, 11:59 PM**. Submit the code for your project in a folder titled `lastname-p7`. Also include in the submission a text file titled `README.md` containing any information the grader needs, references, and citations. E.g., I would submit a folder `tessler-p7` with my project code and a file `README.md`.

A **screencast** is due on **Sunday, April 21th, 11:59 PM**. Host the video on YouTube and provide the link on MyFire.

## Grading

The code and screencast will be graded separately and are equally weighted.

### Code Rubric

**Scope**: To what extent does your code implement the ideas from the course?

**Correctness**: To what extent is your code consistent, workable, and free of bugs?

**Design**: To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

**Style**: To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

**Effort**: Did the project require an appropriate effort on behalf of the student to complete?

Allow categories are weighted equally.

|             | Limited (1)                                                 | Developing (2)                                                            | Competent (3)                                                | Proficient (4)                                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

### Screencast Rubric

The length of your screencast should be sufficient to thoroughly cover all the required elements outlined in the rubric below. While there is no strict time limit, aim for a screencast that is between 30 to 60 minutes long. This should provide enough time to give a comprehensive explanation of your project without overwhelming the viewer with excessive detail.

If you find that your screencast is running significantly shorter than 30 minutes, review the rubric to ensure that you have adequately addressed all the criteria. If your screencast is exceeding 60 minutes, consider streamlining your explanations to be more concise and focused. Your goal should be to strike a balance between providing a detailed, informative walkthrough and maintaining viewer engagement.

Remember, the quality of your explanations is more important than the length of the video. Focus on clearly communicating your thought process, design decisions, and the key aspects of your code. If you have any concerns about the length or content of your screencast, don't hesitate to reach out for guidance.

You might also choose to record your screencast in segments and then merge them together using a tool such as [Adobe Express Video Merger](https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/video/merge).

Ensure your font size is large enough to be seen. 

| Criteria | Weight | Limited (1) | Developing (2) | Competent (3) | Proficient (4) |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Code Walkthrough | 30% | Minimal or no explanation of the code. | Explains some components of the code, but significant gaps in coverage or clarity. | Explains most of the key components of the code, with some details or reasoning missing. | Clearly explains all key components of the code, including design decisions and any challenging aspects. |
| Technical Clarity | 25% | Explanations are very difficult to follow. | Explanations are somewhat unclear or confusing, requiring significant effort to follow. | Mostly clear explanations, but some parts may be confusing or assume too much background knowledge. | Explanations are clear, concise, and easy to follow even for someone not deeply familiar with the project. |
| Use of AI | 25% | No mention of how AI was used. | Briefly mentions AI usage without much detail on integration or reflection. | Mentions the use of AI and how it was integrated, but lacks some details or reflection. | Thoroughly discusses where AI was used, how it was integrated into their own work, and any challenges or benefits encountered. |
| Reflection | 10% | No discussion of learning. | Briefly discusses learnings but without much substance. | Mentions some learnings but without deep reflection or future applications. | Insightfully discusses what they learned and about using AI in a software project. |
| Video Quality | 10% | Poor audio or video quality making it difficult to follow along.| Satisfactory audio and video quality, but some parts may be difficult to hear or see. | Good audio and video quality with only minor issues.
