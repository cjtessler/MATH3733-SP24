# Project 2: Guessing

## Overview

**Read through the entire project description before beginning.**

This project will consist of five parts. Your overall goal is to create a guessing game with different game modes and levels of difficulty. Each part will develop the game further.

In part 1, you will write a mode where the computer chooses a random number, and you need to guess it. In parts 2-4, you will write various guessing algorithms where the computer takes on the role of the guesser and you the role of the number generator. In part 5, you will implement at least one additional feature from a suggested list and document your design process.

*Cite referenced websites and/or collaborators in a file `COLLABORATION.md`. There should be no peer collaboration on part 5. Remember to only discuss problems at a high level with your peers.*

## Policies

### Course Generative AI Policy

No use of ChatGPT, Copilot, or any other automatic code-generation software is allowed in this course for the completion of assignments. The professor may opt to do one or all of the following:

1. Assess and grade the assignment through an oral presentation.
1. Impose a significant penalty for low-energy or unreflective reuse of material generated by AI tools and assign zero points for merely reproducing the output from AI tools.
1. Submit an Academic Integrity Alert after instructors have communicated with the student and determined that AI tools were not used properly.

The course policy supplements, and supersedes, where relevant, the university’s [Generative AI Policy](https://catalog.seu.edu/content.php?catoid=49&navoid=4207#generaitve-assistance-ai-use-policy).

### Collaboration Policy

Students may collaborate on the projects, meaning you're free to seek help from the professor, the internet, or your friends. Any code referenced on internet forums, Stack Overflow, tutorials, or any similar resource that is used to solve a problem should be cited in comments. If two or more students choose to solve a problem together, they are required to write code independently and note all the collaborators. Students cannot use the exact same code (for example, by dictating to each other). As a rule of thumb,  do not look at or copy each other’s code or code structure. Students are not permitted to share/send code to others. The official collaboration policy is that two students may discuss a solution together, but the code must be written separately by each student. No plagiarism or copying of solutions is allowed. **Violations of this policy will result in a zero on the project.**

## Instructions

First, read [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and begin following recommended coding conventions. Google also has a [Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

A significant amount of starter code has been provided. It will handle the flow of the program, but it is up to you to implement the logic for the different game modes. Carefully read through the starter code to understand how the flow of the program. **You will complete the four functions in the "Student Code" section of `main.py` in parts 1 through 4.**

You are also provided with two utility functions `validated_input` and `get_random_positive_int`. These are wrappers for the `input` and `random.randint` functions. Review their implementation in `utils.py`. You might need to write your own utility functions to complete part 5. Do so in `main.py` as the grader will use the initial implementation of `utils.py`.

The random number generator is seeded so that it will generate the same sequence of random numbers on every run. Feel free to change `SEED` in `utils.py` to experiment. The grader will use `SEED = 1`.

To begin, set up the same folder and file structure in your own Codespace and copy over the starter code.

### Part 1

You will need to implement the function `play_guess_mode`. In this mode, the user will play as "the guesser" and have to guess the number the program randomly generated. Use `validated_input` to ensure the user cannot crash the program by entering invalid input. The number of guesses it takes should be tracked and shown upon success. Here is the running of a valid implementation:

``` text
How do you want to play?
1: as the guesser
2: as the number generator
> 1
Hello Guesser! I, the computer 🤖, am thinking of a number.
> 10
🤖: Too low. Try again!
> -10 
> 10.1
> 10.0
🤖: Too low. Try again!
> 140893
🤖: Too high! Try again!
> 140892
🤖: That's it! It took you 4 guess(es).
Play again?
1: Yes
2: No
> 2
Thanks for playing!
```

### Part 2

You will need to complete the function `play_generator_mode_easy`. In this mode, the user will play as "the number generator". The computer should randomly guess until it guesses the number inputted by the user. The number of guesses it takes the computer should be tracked and shown upon success.

You can use the `sleep` function from the `time` module to slow down the computer. The following example shows the usage of the `sleep` function:

```python
from time import sleep, ctime
print(f"Start: {ctime()}")
sleep(5)
print(f"End: {ctime()}")
```

When the program is run, it produces the following:

``` text
Start: Mon Jan 31 19:57:44 2022
End: Mon Jan 31 19:57:49 2022
```

Here is the running of a valid implementation:

``` text

1: Yes
2: No
> 2

```

### Part 3

You will need to complete the function `play_generator_mode_medium`. In this mode, the user will play as "the number generator". The computer should intelligently guess linearly until overshooting and then reverse direction using a lower magnitude. See the output below for an example of the strategy. The number of guesses it takes the computer should be tracked and shown upon success.

You may use the provided helper function `human_responds` to inform the user if they were too high or show. Be sure to read the docstring to see how this function works. Note that the computer overshoots the guess, then `abs(previous_response - current_response) == 2`.

Here is the running of a valid implementation:

```

### Part 4

You will need to complete the function `play_generator_mode_hard`. In this mode, the user will play as "the number generator". The computer should intelligently guess using a bisection search. See the output below for an example of the strategy. The number of guesses it takes the computer should be tracked and shown upon success.

Note that initially, the computer will need to start with a linear search to find low and high values in order to begin the bisection search.

Here is the running of a valid implementation:

```

Note that the (modified) linear search actually performed better in this case.

### Part 5

**No peer collaboration should take place on part 5 since there are many ways this task can be completed.** Speak to the professor or TA if you need assistance.

To begin, copy the contents of `main.py` to `main-p5.py`.

You will need to implement an additional piece of functionally and document how you implemented it in a file titled `Part-5.md`. This is a markdown file, which is a common file format for documentation. Watch [Markdown Crash Course](https://youtu.be/HUBNt18RFbo) for a brief overview on how to format markdown document. You may choose to implement one of the following:

- Implement a **player-vs-player** mode where one user enters a number without the other play looking, hides it, and then prompts opponent
- Implement an option where the user can limit the number of guess until the guesser loses
  - This limit should be adjustable by the user and be able to be turned on and off
- Implement an option where the user specifies a range in which the numbers will occur
  - This range should be adjustable by the user and be able to be turned on and off
- Allow float and negative values in all game modes
  - You might want to consider rounding to decimal places
  - The computer and human should both be able to set these values as the number-to-guess and guess with them.

Documentation of the feature should be at least two paragraphs explaining your thought process, what functions were modified, and how so. Include code blocks.

| **\-5 to -10**       | Debugging statements left in the final program. This makes it difficult to follow logic.                                                                                                                                         |
