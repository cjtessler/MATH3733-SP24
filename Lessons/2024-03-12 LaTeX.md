# Day 13: $LaTeX$

First, look at The Pentagon journal from Kappa Mu Epsilon: https://www.kappamuepsilon.org/.

[OverLeaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) is an online, collaborative LaTeX editor.

Today's lesson is a demo of LaTeX, where we will go through most of the [Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes) tutorial.

- $LaTeX$ (pronounced “LAY-tek” or “LAH-tek”) is a tool for typesetting professional-looking documents.
- "WYSIWYG” versus ("WYSIWYM")
- You only need to focus on the content of your document and the computer, via LaTeX commands and the TeX engine, will take care of the visual appearance (formatting).

## Demo

You will see the following from the blank template:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx} % Required for inserting images

\title{blank}
\author{cjtessler}
\date{March 2024}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\section{Introduction}

\end{document}
```

### Formatting

Let's start from scratch, though. A LaTeX document starts with a document class. The square brackets are optional arguments, whereas the curly braces are required arguments.

```latex
\documentclass{article}

\begin{document}
This is my first document. I am typing stuff.
This is a second sentence. I need this to go to go to another line.

This is a second paragraph.
\end{document}
```

We can use the `textbf` command to make a sentence bold:

```latex
This is my first document. I am typing stuff.
\textbf{This is a second sentence.}
I need this to go to another line.
```

We can see other formatting options here: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bold%2C_italics_and_underlining. More on this later.

### Preamble
The **preamble** is where we set up the document. In case we need to leave comments in our `.tex` file, we can prefix the line with the percent symbol `%`.

```latex
% Preamble
\documentclass{article}

\title{Demo}

\author{Cody Tessler}

\date{January 2022} % overwrites today's date

% Document
\begin{document}

\maketitle

...

\end{document}
```

Let's look at other `documentclass`'s:

- `\documentclass{book}`
- `\documentclass[12pt, letterpaper]{article}`

Before moving on, take a look at the error messages.

## Document Features

### More formatting

```latex
\textit{Let's talk about \underline{cats}!}
```

The `emph` command behaves differently in different environments:

```latex
\textit{\emph{Let's} talk about \underline{cats}!} They are \emph{adorable}!
```

### Images

Import the `graphicsx` package: https://ctan.org/pkg/graphicx?lang=en.

```latex
% In preamble
% /images directory created
\usepackage{graphicx}
\graphicspath{ {images/} } 
```

Put a cat picture in the project. We will use the `includegraphics` command to include the images.

```latex
% In document
%\includegraphics{ cat }
%\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{ cat }

% Using autocomplete...
% Add width=\textwidth option
% Add h option - float "here"
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{cat}
    \caption{Not my cat}
    \label{fig:cat}
\end{figure}

We see in figure \ref{fig:cat} a very sad cat.
```

Other positioning commands can be found here: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Floats,_Figures_and_Captions

### Lists

We use the `itemize` and `enumerate` environments for unordered and ordered lists, respectively.. 

```latex
Cats are
\begin{itemize} % unordered list
    \item fluffy
    \item sleepy
    \item hungry
\end{itemize}

They require
\begin{enumerate} % ordered list
    \item food
    \item sleep
    \item attention
\end{enumerate}
```

### Math

There are two modes for typsetting mathematics:

- *inline* math mode used for writing formulas that are part of a paragraph
- *display* math mode used to write expressions that are not part of a text or paragraph and are typeset on separate lines

```latex
Did you know!? Cats like doing math... sometimes. They know how to solve quadratic equations of the form $ax^2 + bc + c = 0 $.

They solve these equations using the quadratic formula \[ 
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]
```

### Sections

See https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes#Chapters_and_sections. 

Now, complete the full document and use the `\tableofcontents` command.

### Project 4

See https://github.com/cjtessler/MATH3733-SP24/tree/main/Projects/P4_LaTeX.
